        <pre class="bio">The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971,
with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. Their original line-up 
consisted of the American actor/musicians Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork 
with English actor/singer Davy Jones. The four actor/musicians were initially allowed only limited 
roles in the recording studio for the first few months of their five-year career as "the Monkees". 
This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless, Nesmith 
composed and produced some songs from the beginning, and Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions 
produced by Nesmith. All four contributed lead vocals to various tracks. They eventually fought for the right 
to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name, acting as actors, musicians, singers, songwriters, 
and producers. Following the television show's cancellation in 1968, the Monkees continued to record music until 1971, 
after which the group broke up. A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of 
reunion tours and new records. The group has reunited and toured several times since then with different line-ups 
(but always containing Micky Dolenz and at least one of the other original members) and with varying degrees of success. 
Jones died in February 2012 and Tork died in February 2019. Dolenz and Nesmith remain active members of the group.</pre>
